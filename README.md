just a test of hosting a chrome extension on github pages.

## installation

1. right-click and download [this crx file](http://adammw.github.io/miniature-octo-widgit/dummy-chrome-extension-0.0.21.crx) somewhere locally
1. open chrome://extensions
1. drag the downloaded crx file into the page (not from the downloads tray but from Finder)
1. click add (to install the extension), notice that v0.0.21 is installed
1. scroll up and select developer mode, then click update extensions now
1. find the dummy extension and notice that it should now say v0.0.22 and have a updated title
